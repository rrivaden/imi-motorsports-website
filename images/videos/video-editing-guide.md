# Video Editing Guide for Motorsports Background Video

## Evaluating the Source Video

The source video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMRku0BYqvU) should be edited to:

1. **Highlight exciting motorsport action** that represents IMI Motorsports
2. **Create a smooth loop** for continuous playback
3. **Optimize for web delivery** while maintaining visual impact
4. **Work well with overlaid text** in the hero section

## Recommended Editing Approach

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
Review the full YouTube video to identify:
- The most dynamic motorsports moments
- Sections with good lighting and clear visibility
- Segments that would work well as a background (not too distracting)
- Portions that have relatively consistent color grading

### Step 2: Select the Best 10-30 Second Segment
The ideal segment should:
- Begin and end with similar compositions for seamless looping
- Avoid any text overlays from the original video
- Feature impressive motorsports action that showcases IMI facilities
- Have good brightness/contrast that won't interfere with website text

### Step 3: Editing Techniques

#### A. Trimming and Timing
- Cut to 10-30 seconds maximum (15-20 seconds is often ideal)
- If creating a loop, ensure the start and end frames match as closely as possible
- Consider slow-motion for particularly dramatic moments (25-50% speed)

#### B. Color Correction
- Increase contrast slightly to make the action "pop"
- Consider a subtle vignette to focus attention on the center
- Apply a light color grade that enhances the IMI brand colors
- Ensure the upper portion has enough brightness contrast for white text

#### C. Motion and Stabilization
- Stabilize any shaky footage
- Consider subtle Ken Burns effect (slow zoom) if needed for static shots
- For fast action sequences, ensure they're not too jarring

#### D. Creative Effects
- Consider adding a subtle dark gradient overlay at the top (where text will appear)
- Apply a light motion blur to very fast sections if they appear too choppy
- Consider a light dust/particle overlay for dirt track footage

### Step 4: Export Settings for Web

#### MP4 Format (H.264)
- Resolution: 1920Ã—1080 (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Framerate: Match source or reduce to 24-30fps
- Bitrate: 2500-5000 kbps (target 5-10MB total file size)
- Audio: Remove completely
- Color: sRGB color space
- Quality: High, but prioritize file size

#### WebM Format (VP9)
- Same resolution and framerate as MP4
- Target a similar or smaller file size than the MP4 version
- VP9 codec for better compression

## Best Practices for Motorsports Video Backgrounds

1. **Feature Motion:** Emphasize the speed and excitement of motorsports
2. **Balance Action:** Too much fast movement can be distracting, too little can be boring
3. **Text Readability:** Ensure areas where text will overlay have consistent color/brightness
4. **Brand Alignment:** The video should reinforce the IMI Motorsports brand image
5. **Optimize Load Time:** Keep final file sizes as small as possible while maintaining quality

## Video Content Suggestions

Based on the YouTube link, focus on:
- Vehicles in motion (rather than static shots)
- Wide angle shots showing multiple vehicles if possible
- Dynamic camera movements that follow the action
- Moments that capture the excitement of motorsports

## Testing the Final Video

Before finalizing:
1. Test the video with the actual website hero text overlaid
2. Verify the loop is seamless (watch for several cycles)
3. Check load time on various connection speeds
4. Test autoplay functionality across different browsers
5. Confirm the video fades in properly from the poster image
