# IMI Motorsports Logo Guidelines

## Logo Design Concept

For the new IMI Motorsports website, I recommend a modern, dynamic logo that embodies speed, precision, and excitement. Here's the design concept:

### Main Elements
1. **Bold Typography**: "IMI" in large, strong letters with "MOTORSPORTS" in a smaller size beneath it
2. **Racing Element**: Incorporate a subtle checkered flag pattern or racing stripe
3. **Color Scheme**: Use the site's primary red (#e63946) and navy (#1d3557) with yellow accent (#ffd166)

### Logo Variations
- **Full Logo**: Complete text with graphic element for website header, marketing materials
- **Compact Logo**: Just "IMI" with small icon for favicons, mobile display
- **Icon Only**: Racing element alone for app icons, social media profiles where space is limited

## Image Resources for Website

To complete the website, you'll need various high-quality images. Here are recommendations for sourcing them:

### Professional Stock Photography
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - Search terms: motorsports, racing, go-kart, motocross
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - Free high-quality stock photos
- [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/) - Premium option with motorsports collections

### Free Motorsport-Specific Images
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) - Search for "racing", "motorsports", "karting"
- [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) - Has free and premium motorsports images

### Image Guidelines
1. **Hero Images**: Large, dramatic shots (min. 1920x1080px) showing action and excitement
2. **Track/Facility Images**: Clean, well-lit photos showcasing your facilities (approx. 800x600px)
3. **Testimonial Photos**: Professional-looking portraits of customers (300x300px)
4. **Blog Images**: Relevant, attention-grabbing images for each article (800x500px)

### Image Optimization
Before uploading images to the website:
1. Compress all images using tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)
2. Maintain consistent aspect ratios for similar image categories
3. Create WebP versions alongside JPG/PNG for better performance
4. Add descriptive, SEO-friendly filenames (e.g., "imi-motorsports-go-kart-racing.jpg")

Once you have your logo designed, create versions in multiple formats (PNG with transparency, SVG for scalability, and JPG for certain applications) and different sizes to ensure flexibility across all platforms.
